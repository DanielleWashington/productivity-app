## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- 💎 Identity drives behavior. Behavior compounds into results.
- 🎯 One focused action compounds more than scattered effort.

- 🌿 Recovery isn't passive. It's where integration happens.

**Tone:** Calm, authoritative, principle-based. No urgency. No guilt.

**Theme:** Ethereal pink and magenta with whimsical touches.

**Constraint:** Fear of being seen as an imposter

### The Strategist
**Journey:** Foundation Builder → Strategist → Optimizer → Architect  
**Focus:** Scalable systems that maximize impact with minimal energy  
**Constraint:** Perfectionism that delays shipping

### The Sovereign
**Journey:** Grounded Leader → Balanced Creator → Sovereign → Integrated Whole  
**Focus:** Sustainable leadership that honors energy and boundaries  
**Constraint:** Burnout from overextension

### The Majesty
**Journey:** Learner → Integrator → Celebrator → Majesty

## 💡 Philosophy

Traditional productivity apps focus on habits and tasks. Quantum Leap focuses on **identity**.

**The difference:**
- ❌ "I need to write more" → ✅ "I am a writer who ships weekly"
- ❌ "I should post on LinkedIn" → ✅ "I am visible and share expertise generously"
- ❌ "I need better habits" → ✅ "I am becoming the person I want to be"

When you change your identity, behavior follows naturally.

## 📬 Support

This is a personal project. No official support, but feel free to:
- Customize for your own use
- Share with others
- Build upon the foundation
